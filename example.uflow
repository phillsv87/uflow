# Example User Flow

Jeff opens VSCode

He then sees a file named example.uflow and opens it

IF Jeff has the UFlow extension installed THEN

    he sees syntax highlighting and can easily read and understand the logical structure

ELSE

    Jeff doesn't see any syntax highlighting but can see the file is neatly indented and
    it kind of looks like a programming mixed with normal english

    IF Jeff is new to VSCode and doesn't know about extensions
        RUN NewVsCodeUser

    Jeff opens the extensions panel and searches for UFlow

    He sees the the UFlow extension and installs it

END


Jeff is inspired by the simple human readable syntax. It allows him to write complex user flows
in plan text and his user flows are now trackable with Git.

Jeff vows to use UFlow for all future projects until the end of time.

IF Jeff is tried of programming THEN

    RUN TakeATrip

    IF Jeff is huger after taking a long trip
        RUN EatSomeBuggers 

END

Jeff calls it a night and goes to bed
