# Example User Flow

User opens VSCode

The user sees a file a file named example.uflow  and opens it

IF the user has the UFlow extension installed

    The user sees syntax highlighting

ELSE

    IF the user is new to VSCode and doesn't know about extensions
        RUN NewVsCodeUser

    The user opens the extensions panel and searches for UFlow

    The user sees the the UFlow extension and installs it

    The user returns to the example.uflow file and now sees syntax highlighting

END


The user is inspired by the simple human readable syntax that allows a complex user flow
to be describe in plain text and is trackable with GIT.

The user vows to use UFlow for all future projects until the end of time.

IF the user is tired of programming
    RUN SpendThatMoney

RUN TakeATrip

EXIT




FLOW NewVsCodeUser

    The user is curious as to what a .uflow file is

    WHEN the user operation system IS

        ~ Macos
            Do some kind of magical gesture on their track pad and safari comes flying in

        ~ Windows
            Clicks on the Chrome icon in the task bar because no one uses Edge

        ~ Linux
            May vary based on distro

        ~ ALL OTHER CASES
            How did they install VSCode?

    END

    
    Now that the users has a web browser open the search for "What is a .uflow file"

    The user sees a link to the UFlow vscode extension page

    The user follows the link and reads about how to install the UFlow extension

END


FLOW SpendThatMoney

    The user receives a random amount of money between $50 to $100 and puts it in his $wallet

    WHILE $wallet is not empty

        The user pays $1 for a cheese burger using his $wallet

    END

    The user regrests eating too many cheese buggers

END


FLOW TakeATrip

    The user is preparing to fly his plane to Katmandu

    He must first
    - Check his fuel level
    - Rest his arms, it's going to be a long flight
    - Tighten the propellor


    The user starts to taxi down the run way and is now ready to take off

    The user now
    1. Hammers down on the throttle
    2. Pulls back on the stick
    3. Closes his eyes

    The user is now some how in the air

    [backend]
    The users successful landing count is incremented in the database

    About 100 hours later the user lands safely at Katmandu

    # the -- syntax is used to mark a step as removed from the flow
    --The user refuels his plane

    The user has a beer with Bob Seger
