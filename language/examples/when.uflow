A user wants to open a web browser

WHEN the user's operation system IS

    ~ Macos
        They do some kind of magical gesture on their track pad and safari comes flying in

    ~ Windows
        They click on the Chrome icon in the task bar because no one uses Edge

    ~ Linux
        May vary based on distro

    ~ ALL OTHER CASES
        They do what they have to do to survive
